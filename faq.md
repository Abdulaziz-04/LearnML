# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I need a Master’s Degree?

If you are going to spend the time to study AI/ML then you might as well invest in an online degree which will greatly increase your career opportunities (and a requirment for most AI engineer positions).

## Recommended Tutorials and Books

Choosing a ML learning resource is primarliy a matter of personal preference. In geneal, I recommend that you refer to more than one resource (other than scikit-learn, tensorflow, and PyTorch documentation) when learning ML. 

If you have an .edu email account you can get free access to [oreilly.com](https://www.oreilly.com/) which has two good books for beginners that are available “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow” and “Python Machine Learning: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow”. There also many other good books on various AI/ML topics available on oreilly.com

## How to Choose an ML Algorithm?

Every new ML engineer finds that they need to decide what model to use for a problem.

There are many models to choose from with seemingly endless variants, but there are usually only slight alterations needed to change a regression model into a classification model and vice versa.

There are a lot of models to choose from, so consider starting with regression models to obtain a simple baseline for comparison. This work has already been done for you with the standard scikit-learn supervised learning packages, so you only need to select what option you want.

Keep in mind that the model you choose should do better than simple regression. 

The best practice is to evaluate many algorithms (say 10-20) using an AutoML tool such as Orange or PyCaret then narrow the choices to a few models based on accuracy and error metrics. Then, create a test harness to fully explore the candidates.

## Should I start learning ML by coding an algorithm from scratch?

You need to know what algorithms are available for a given problem, how they work, and how to get the most out of them. However, this does not mean you need to hand-code the algorithms from scratch.

In fact, there are many other concepts that are much more important than knowing how to implement an ML algorithm:

- How to properly define an ML problem?
- How to select a dataset?
- How to perform data preparation?
- How to design an ML solution?
- How to properly train an ML model?
- How to choose a Performance/Error Metric?
- How to deploy an ML solution?
- How to debug ML models?

In short, it is best to understand the big picture (top-down approach) of the ML engineering process before delving into the implementation details (bottom-up approach).
