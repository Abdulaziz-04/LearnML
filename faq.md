# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I need a Master’s Degree?

[Do you need a Master’s Degree in Data Science?](https://towardsdatascience.com/do-you-need-a-masters-degree-in-data-science-you-are-asking-the-wrong-question-8c83dec8bf1b?source=rss----7f60cf5620c9---4)

If you are going to spend the time to study AI/ML then you might as well invest in an online degree which will greatly increase your career opportunities (and a requirement for most all AI/ML engineer positions).

## Is image channels first or last?

A huge gotcha with both PyTorch and Keras. Actually, you need to sometimes need to to watch out when running code between OS (NHWC vs NCHW). I spent a long time tracking down an obscure error message between Linux and macOS that turned out to be the memory format.
