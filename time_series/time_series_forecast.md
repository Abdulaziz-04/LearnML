# Time Series Forecasting

## 5-Step Forecasting Task

The 5 basic steps in a forecasting task are summarized by Hyndman and Athana­sopou­los in their book Forecasting: principles and practice. These steps are:

1. Problem Definition. The careful consideration of who requires the forecast and how the forecast will be used. 

This is described as the most difficult part of the process, most likely because it is entirely problem specific and subjective.

2. Gathering Information. The collection of historical data to analyze and model. 

This also includes getting access to domain experts and gathering information that can help to best interpret the historical information and ultimately the forecasts that will be made.

3. Preliminary Exploratory Analysis. The use of simple tools such as graphing and summary statistics to better understand the data. 

Review plots and summarize and note obvious temporal structures auch as trends, seasonality, anomalies such missing data, corruption, and outliers, and any other structures that may impact forecasting.

4. Choosing and Fitting Models. Evaluate two, three, or a suite of models of varying types on the problem. 

Models may be chosen for evaluation based on the assumptions they make and whether the dataset conforms. 

Models are configured and fit to the historical data.

5. Using and Evaluating a Forecasting Model. The model is used to make forecasts and the performance of those forecasts is evaluated and the skill of the models is estimated. 

This may involve back-testing with historical data or waiting for new observations to become available for comparison.

This 5-step process provides a strong overview from starting off with an idea or problem statement and leading to a model that can be used to make predictions.

The focus of the process is on understanding the problem and fitting a good model.

How to analyze a time series? To answer this question, you’ll have to understand two fundamental concepts in time series — trend and seasonality.

As the name suggests, trend represents the general movement over time while seasonality represents changes in behavior in the course of a single season. 

For example, most monthly sampled data have yearly seasonality, meaning some patterns repeat in certain months every year, regardless of the trend.
