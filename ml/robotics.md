# What Is Robotics?

Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines called robots that substitute for (or replicate) human actions.

While the overall world of robotics is expanding, a robot has some consistent characteristics:

1. Robots all consist of some sort of mechanical construction.

The mechanical aspect of a robot helps it complete tasks in the environment for which it is designed.

For example, the Mars 2020 Roverâ€™s wheels are individually motorized and made of titanium tubing that help it firmly grip the harsh terrain of the red planet.

2. Robots need electrical components that control and power the machinery.

Essentially, an electric current (such as a battery) is needed to power a majority of robots.

3. Robots contain at least some level of computer programming.

Without a set of code telling it what to do, a robot would just be another piece of simple machinery.

Inserting a program into a robot gives it the ability to know when and how to carry out a task.
