# LearnML

If you are like me and try to follow the principles of DRY, KISS, and Occam’s Razor then this repo is for you!

In short, the best model that fits your data is usually the best. 

As an AI/ML engineer, be willing to settle for “good enough” rather than trying to find the “best” model/approach.

Please note that I am not a fan of Scrum (which is actually a project management approach rather than a software development methodology) [1]. I prefer using an iterative, agile feature-driven development (FDD) methdology [2] which I have found is more scalable to larger projects. 

This repo contains notes from various articles and other resources on a variety of topics in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This is a work in progress (just getting started), so there is still a lot missing and the content is changing.
