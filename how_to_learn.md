# How to Learn Machine Learning

As a professional AI engineer and software engineer with 25+ years of experience, I have a lot of experience in designing and implementing a variety of software applications and technologies. Thus, I have used and implemented hundreds (perhaps thousands) of various software libraries, frameworks, and APIs. 

I also have a M.S. in Mathematics and MSCS in Aritifical Intelligence, so I am more than qualified to mentor and teach computer science and software engineering courses.

Since this is an AI forum, I believe most users will be making the following assumptions:

- You are interested in becoming an AI/ML engineer
- You are interested in learning/following software engineering best practices

If not then it is best to let users know when you post that it is only your hobby, experimenting, etc.)

Here are some beginner mistakes to avoid when learning ML:

- Avoid asking "What is the best algorithm for ..."
- Avoid trying to code ML algorithms from scratch
- Avoid trying to do things manually
- Avoid using neural networks (only as last resort)

Here are some beginner tips for learning ML:

- How to properly define an ML problem?
- How to select a dataset?
- How to perform data preparation?
- How to select an ML algorithm?
- How to properly train an ML model?
- How to design and deploy an ML solution?


In graduate school, we are taught that the proper technique for learning ML is to take a black-box view of ML algorithms (top-down approach) since it is best not to waste time trying to hand-code algorithms (bottom-up approach), especially when you are just getting started. In fact, you will find that there is very little to learn by focusing on the internal implementation of an algorithm that will be useful in learning how best to use and deploy it.

In software engineering, there are many well-known principles such as DRY, KISS, and Occam's Razor. Perhaps the most important principle is "don't reinvent the wheel". Nevertheless, it seems as though every beginner in machine learning proceeds to try to implement a neural network from scratch.

A professional AI engineer knows that the latest trend is a data-centric rather than model-centric approach to machine learning. Therefore, a beginner would be wise to focus on learning data preparation, feature engineering, dimenstionality reduction, and other techniques rather than focus on the implementation details of a particular ML model.

In addition, an ML software engineer needs to know the best use of ALL software libraries and APIs that are used in an application, not just ML libraries. 


Automation is a big part of modern software development (build, test, and deployment), so the chances of you ever implementing and deploying a ML algorithm hand-coded is slim to none (don't reinvent the wheel). In fact, there are a multitude of reasons to avoid writing custom code when robust, well-proven libraries and frameworks are readily available. You can spend an entire career just learning the proper use of software libraries and frameworks. Therefore, there are plenty of other topics that you should explore that are much more important than trying to understand the internals of a particular ML algorithm (unless you are designing an open-source ML library or framework).


In general, Fortune 500 and other companies are not going to implement and deploy a custom algorithm hand-coded from scratch. It is also a software engineering best practice to  use software that has been rigorously proven and tested for both R&D and production. Therefore, it is common practice to use commercial and open-source frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch rather than code algorithms from scratch.

Once you have mastered using ML algorithms, you can go back later and try to understand how they work internally by coding them by hand (if needed). However, there are far too many ML algorithms for the average software developer to ever code and understand all the details needed to properly implement them.
