## Tutorials and Books

Choosing an ML learning resource is primarliy a matter of personal preference. In geneal, I recommend that you refer to more than one resource (other than scikit-learn, tensorflow, and PyTorch documentation) when learning ML.

"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach" by S. Russell and P. Norvig (4th ed.) is an excellent graduate textbook on AI/ML. 

Here are some ML textbooks that I found helpful:

- E. Alpaydin, Introduction to Machine Learning, 3rd ed., MIT Press, ISBN: 978-0262028189, 2014. 

- S. Raschka. and V. Mirjalili, Python Machine Learning, 2nd ed. Packt, ISBN: 978-1787125933, 2017.

- S. Bird, E. Klein, and E. Loper. Natural Language Processing with Python – Analyzing Text with the Natural Language Toolkit. Available online at https://www.nltk.org/book/.

If you have an .edu email account you can get free access to [oreilly.com](https://www.oreilly.com/) which has two good books for beginners that are available “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow” and “Python Machine Learning: Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow”. I also found the "Pragmatic Bookshelf" series to be helpful including "Programming Machine Learning". There are also many other good books on various AI/ML topics available on oreilly.com.

Every professional software engineer should be able to navigate the [SWEBOK](https://www.computer.org/education/bodies-of-knowledge/software-engineering/v3) and learn the key software engineering concepts that it contains since IEEE is the de facto authority on software and hardware technologies. 


## Consulting and Freelance

If you ever do consulting or freelance work in the U.S. for $$, you should be aware that there are legal implications and I found [TODO] to be a clear, concise resource on the topic. I am sure there are similar rules and regulations in the EU and elsewhere.
