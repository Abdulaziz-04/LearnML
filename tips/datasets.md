# Datasets

Here is a collection of some resources for ML datasets.

## [Read Datasets with URL in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/dont-download-read-datasets-with-url-in-python-8245a5eaa919)

A tutorial to read UCI datasets without downloading them locally in any format

This tutorial explains how you can read five different types of data file format: data, csv, arff, zip, and rar

## [How to generate dummy data in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-generate-dummy-data-in-python-a05bce24a6c6)


How to generate fake data using the Faker library. 



## [huggingface](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets)

Datasets is a lightweight library providing two main features:

- one-line dataloaders for many public datasets: one liners to download and pre-process any of the number of datasets major public datasets (in 467 languages and dialects!) provided on the HuggingFace Datasets Hub.

- efficient data pre-processing: simple, fast and reproducible data pre-processing for the above public datasets as well as your own local datasets in CSV/JSON/text. 


## [Open Source Datasets for Computer Vision](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/08/open-source-datasets-computer-vision.html)

This article discuses some of th popular datasets used in the Deep Learning (DL) to train state-of-the-art ML systems for CV tasks.


## [nlp-datasets](https://github.com/niderhoff/nlp-datasets)

Alphabetical list of free/public domain datasets with text data for use in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Most stuff here is just raw unstructured text data, if you are looking for annotated corpora or Treebanks refer to the sources at the bottom.


## [Datasets for Natural Language Processing](https://machinelearningmastery.com/datasets-natural-language-processing/)

You need datasets to practice on when getting started with deep learning for natural language processing tasks.

It is better to use small datasets that you can download quickly and do not take too long to fit models. Further, it is also helpful to use standard datasets that are well understood and widely used so that you can compare your results to see if you are making progress.

In this post, you will discover a suite of standard datasets for natural language processing tasks that you can use when getting started with deep learning.

This post is divided into 7 parts:

1. Text Classification
2. Language Modeling
3. Image Captioning
4. Machine Translation
5. Question Answering
6. Speech Recognition
7. Document Summarization
